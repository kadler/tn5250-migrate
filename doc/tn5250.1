.TH TN5250 1 "30 Jul 2001"
.SH NAME
tn5250 \- an implementation of the 5250 telnet protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tn5250
.RI [\| OPTIONS \|]
.IR host [\|: port \|]
.br
.B xt5250
.RI [\| OPTIONS \|]
.RI [\| host [\|: port \|]\|]
.br
.B tn5250 \-version
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B tn5250
emulates IBM's 5250 compatible terminals to connect over TCP/IP to an
IBM AS/400.  The terminal emulation works on any local terminal
supported by curses, and provides 132x27 and full colour support where
possible.
.PP
.B tn5250
will connect to the given
.IR host 's
telnet port, or a different
.I port
if specified.  The host name may be preceded by a
.IR protocol :
which specifies either to use telnet to the host, if omitted or set to
.I telnet
or
.IR tn5250 ,
or to replay a session dumped using the
.B trace
option if set to
.IR debug .
.PP
An IBM 5250 terminal supports a number of special keys, and does a lot 
of processing itself before sending data to the host system.  Because
a standard ASCII terminal does not support all these keys,
.B tn5250
uses control sequences to perform the operations.
.PP
Named session support (with the
.B env.DEVNAME
option) is available for most versions of OS/400, but is only supplied
with V4R3 and later versions.  For V3R2, V3R7, V4R1 and V4R2, please
see informational APAR II10918.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI trace= FILE
Log all
.B tn5250
actions to
.IR tracefile .
This file will get very large, and may contain sensitive information
such as the password used to log in.
.TP
.BI map= CCSID
Set the translation table between ASCII and EBCDIC.  This should match
the CCSID of the interactive job.  The default for
.B tn5250
is
.BR 37 .
See
.B Translation Maps
below for more information.
.TP
.BI env.DEVNAME= NAME
Set the device name for the AS/400 to assign to the 5250 session.
This should be up to ten characters long and consist of only letters
and numbers.  It will be converted to uppercase and used as the name
of the 5250-compatible device on the AS/400.  There may only be one
session active with any given name at one time.
.TP
.BI env.TERM= TYPE
Set the terminal model name for the emulation session to use.  The
default depends on whether the terminal supports colour, and whether
it is large enough to support the large terminal size.  See
.B Display Types
below for valid model names.
.TP
.BI env. VARIABLE = VALUE
Set any other environment variables controlling the terminal session.
A list of relevant variables is given in section 5 of
.BR RFC2877 .
.TP
.B +/\-underscores
Force or disable the use of underscore characters instead of the underline
attribute, for terminals that do not support underlining but where
.B tn5250
does not work this out itself.
.TP
.B +/\-ruler
Turn the ruler feature on or off.  When enabled, the row and column of
the cursor will be highlighted.
.TP
.B \-version
Display the version of
.B tn5250
and exit.
.SH EXAMPLES
These are some examples of the use of
.BR tn5250 :
.TP
.I "tn5250 as400sys"
Connect to the system
.IR as400sys ,
using the default translation map (37)
and a generated session name
.RI (QPADEV #### ).
.TP
.I "tn5250 map=870 env.DEVNAME=session1 env.TERM=IBM-3477-FC as400sys"
Connect to
.I as400sys
using the translation map for CCSID 870 (Eastern Europe), the session
name SESSION1 and with a terminal supporting colour and a 132x27
display.
.SH USAGE
This manual assumes that the user is familiar with a real 5250
terminal, or another 5250 emulator, and only describes features
relevant to
.B tn5250
itself.
.SS "Keyboard Mapping"
The following table lists the 5250 functions implemented by
.BR tn5250 ,
and the corresponding keypresses.  Keys are represented as Emacs does:
.B C-a
means hold
.B Ctrl
and press
.BR A ,
.B M-a
means press
.B Esc
or
.B C-g
followed by
.BR A ,
and
.B C-M-a
means press
.B Esc
or
.B C-g
followed by
.BR C-a .
Most setups also let you use the
.B Alt
or
.B Meta
key for
.B M-
keypresses.

Which keys generate f11-f24, backtab, backspace and delete is very
dependent on the configuration of the terminal.

.LP
.SS Display
The screen display tries to be the same as a colour 5250 terminal.
There are some unavoidable differences though:
.RS
.PP
ASCII terminals (and curses) do not support the 5250 column
separators.
.PP
Some terminals (mostly ones based on the VGA text mode) do not support
underlining.  If this is the case and
.B tn5250
does not detect it automatically, you should pass the
.B \-u
option.
.PP
Some terminals (such as
.BR xterm )
do not support blinking text.
.RE
.SS "Display Types"
The following values are valid for the terminal name option.
The default terminal, if none is specified, is selected from the first
listed below that supports both terminal size and colour support.

.SS "Translation Maps"
CCSIDs on the AS/400 are listed in Appendix G of IBM manual
SC41-5101-01, AS/400 National Language Support.  This manual is
available on the web at
.RI < http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/cgi-bin/bookmgr/BOOKS/QB3AWC01/G.2 >.
.PP
Currently recognised values for the translation map are: 37, 256, 273,
277, 278, 280, 284, 285, 290, 297, 420, 424, 500, 870, 871, 875, 880, 905,
and 1026.  Most of these are translated to ISO-8859-1, also known as
Latin 1.  Some of them contain characters only present in another
encoding, which is used instead.  The valid CCSID values, and the Unix
encoding used, are listed below.
